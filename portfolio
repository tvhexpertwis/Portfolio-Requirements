Hey! My name is Jordan, I am a full stack developer

BIO 

I am a developer who recently graduated from the Thinkful Software Developer bootcamp.
I am excited to start putting the skills I learned from this bootcamp to use. I realize that even when landing a job, I have a lot to learn, which I'm excited about. 
I like coding, because of how it challenges the mind. It mixes logic with problem solving which is a good life value in itself.
